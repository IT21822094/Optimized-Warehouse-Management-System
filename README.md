# Research problem
• Limited Fire Detection: How can we provide
real-time fire alerts near critical areas like racks,
hindering rapid response 

• Inefficient Space Utilization: Lack of intelligent
systems for dynamically optimizing warehouse
space leads to inefficiencies. How can we
address that 

• Route Inefficiency: How can we save time and
energy by minimizing warehouse route
problems 

• Stock Instabilities: How to predict incidents
which address sudden movements in stock,
leading to undetected inventory issues ?
