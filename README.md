# Optimized-Warehouse-Management-System
# Introduction


The Optimized Warehouse Management System is designed to revolutionize warehouse operations through the strategic use of artificial intelligence, computer vision, and operational best practices. It focuses on four critical areas to maximize efficiency, safety, and productivity

# Research problem
• Limited Fire Detection(Vision-Based Fire Detection): How can we leverage existing cameras with 
AI to detect early-stage fires, assess risk, and predict spread in warehouses for faster response

• Inefficient Space Utilization: Lack of intelligent
systems for dynamically optimizing warehouse
space leads to inefficiencies. How can we
address that 

• Route Inefficiency: How can we save time and
energy by minimizing warehouse route
problems 

• Stock Instabilities: How to predict incidents
which address sudden movements in stock,
leading to undetected inventory issues

### IT21822094 | P.A.S.Tharana (Fire detection using computer vision and AI)

## Description
This system uses computer vision and deep learning to detect and monitor fires in warehouses using only CCTV cameras. It identifies fire in real time, measures the fire's size, checks how close it is to shelves or assets, and predicts how it might spread. It gives early alerts and helps workers take quick, safe action—without needing extra sensors or expensive hardware.


## Features
 Camera-Only Operation – Uses existing CCTV cameras without extra sensors

 Real-Time Fire Detection – Identifies fire and smoke instantly using AI

 Fire Size Classification – Categorizes fire as small, medium, or large

 Shelf Proximity Detection – Detects shelves and calculates their distance from fire

 Fire Spread Prediction – Estimates the direction of fire movement using video analysis

 Instant Alerts – Sends sound and visual warnings during fire events

 Live Dashboard – Displays fire location, size, and risk zones in real time

 Data Logging – Records fire events and system responses for review

 Low-Cost Deployment – No need for new hardware; quick and easy setup

 Scalable Design – Can monitor small or large warehouses efficiently
