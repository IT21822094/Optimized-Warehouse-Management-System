predict_forecast_category :

loads the models that are defined in the ForecastModels directory specify only the name that is accepted by the function

this function starts with generating future dates for the forecast here you can define time periods in weeks. like 
for four weeks, six weeks so on.

before training the models we get the data range to a specific range to avoid any noise within the dataset (skewed curves) so when we predicting from the trained model, we have to convert it back to the actual value. 

then making a new dataset with future data that was previously generated and combined them with inbound and outbound predicted values.

applies rolling average to smooth the curves, why ? it easier to read than reading the trend with more noise.
trend become more noise if there were no rolling windows applied.

then calculating the data points that are not going with the predicted values a threshold will be applied to calculate the values.
