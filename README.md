# Optimized-Warehouse-Management-System
# Introduction


The Optimized Warehouse Management System is designed to revolutionize warehouse operations through the strategic use of artificial intelligence, computer vision, and operational best practices. It focuses on four critical areas to maximize efficiency, safety, and productivity

# Research problem
• Limited Fire Detection: How can we provide
real-time fire alerts near critical areas like racks,
hindering rapid response 

• Inefficient Space Utilization: Lack of intelligent
systems for dynamically optimizing warehouse
space leads to inefficiencies. How can we
address that 

• Route Inefficiency: How can we save time and
energy by minimizing warehouse route
problems 

• Stock Instabilities: How to predict incidents
which address sudden movements in stock,
leading to undetected inventory issues ?
